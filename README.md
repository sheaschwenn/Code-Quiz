## JavaScript Example

A function to iterate through an array that held the questions, answer options, and correct options.  This function also called another function that displayed a form to input the users initials.  The users initials would then get stored along with their score in local storage to be rendered on the current page as well as on anther page that held all scores. 
```js
var qAndALength = Object.keys(qAndA).length

function whichQandA() {
    console.log("qandALength: " + qAndALength)
    if (i < qAndALength) {
        question.textContent = qAndA[i].question;
        answer1.textContent = qAndA[i].options[0];
        answer2.textContent = qAndA[i].options[1];
        answer3.textContent = qAndA[i].options[2];
        answer4.textContent = qAndA[i].options[3];
        
    }
    if (i === qAndALength) {
        
        console.log("i is equal to length")
    }
    if (i === qAndALength + 1) {
        displayForm()
        console.log("i is greather than length")
    }
}
```

## Learning Points 
This was my first project incoperating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all together in on application, and let me tell you I learned a lot. 

* I gained a much better understanding of event listeners

* APIs in general and how to use them to add functionality to my JavaScript

* Local storage 

* Objects

* And just generally I learned a lot about JavaScript and know that there is so so so much more to learn!
